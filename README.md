Part 2 of DSA Nanodegree
Data StructuresÂ  Learn different data structures that can be used to store data. Implement different methods used to manipulate these data structures and examine the efficiency. Understand the advantages and applications of different data structures. Learn how to approach open ended problems (either in interviews or in real-world scenarios) and select appropriate data structures based on requirements. 
 
Lesson 1: Collection data structures (lists, arrays, linked lists, queues, stack) Lesson 2: Recursion Lesson 3: Trees Lesson 4: Maps and Hashing 
 
Sample Practice Problems: Reverse Strings, Hamming Distance, Reverse a Linked List, Linked List Loop Detection, Balancing Brackets, Building Queue using Stacks, Tree Traversals, Checking Binary Search Tree, String Key Hash table 
 
 Project 2: Show Me the Data Structures Solve a series of open-ended practice problems such as LRU Cache, Private Blockchain, File Recursion and many more. Hone your skills to identify and implement appropriate data structures and corresponding methods which meet given constraints.
